# GLOSA-Bharat: Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory

An AI-powered system designed to optimize urban traffic flow in India, aligned with **Atmanirbhar Bharat** and **Smart City** initiatives.

## Project Overview
GLOSA (Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory) helps drivers maintain a constant speed that allows them to pass through traffic signals during the green phase. This reduces fuel consumption, wear and tear on vehicles, and urban congestion.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React-based dashboard for drivers.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express handling telemetry and geometry logic.
- **AI Service**: Python/FastAPI service predicting signal timings using historical data.
- **Database**: MongoDB for persistent storage of junction data.

## Atmanirbhar Bharat Relevance
- Localized for Indian road conditions and traffic patterns.
- Open-source and scalable for Indian municipalities.
- Reduces dependence on imported hardware by using software-based GPS and AI.

## Getting Started
(Detailed instructions to be added after implementation)
